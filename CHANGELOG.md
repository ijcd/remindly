# Changelog

## 1.5.2 - 2023-4-20

### New

- Uses the `petal_framework` private package (deletes all the `_petal_framework` folders). This will allow for an easier upgrade process in the future, especially for components like the data table.
- Data Table supports `base_url_params`. Keep custom query params when changing sort order.
- Data Table is now self contained in the live view - code isn't scattered across the model and context.

- Use `<.flash_group>` to show flash messages (Petal Framework 0.3.0)
